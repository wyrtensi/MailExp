// Before #417 there was no rung on this ladder the user could set. In the unified inbox
// there is no selected account, so the sender fell through to whichever account was last
// sent from, recorded in localStorage. That drifts: send once from a secondary address and
// every later compose defaults to it, silently, until you send from something else. Being
// in localStorage it also never followed the user to another device, unlike the rest of
// their settings.
