# MailExpert plugins

MailExpert features can live as **plugins**: self-contained modules that talk to core only through a
fixed, reviewed capability surface. **GTD** (`gtd/`) is the reference plugin and the first fully
extracted one.

The point of the boundary is trust: a plugin **cannot** reach into core, the mail engine, the
database, the network, or other users' data — so a plugin change can be reviewed for *feature
correctness*, not for whether it could compromise the app. That's what lets a contributor own a
plugin without a deep security review of every PR.

Two tiers (conceptual): **Tier-1** = trusted, in-repo (like GTD today); **Tier-2** = untrusted /
third-party. Both use the *same* capability surface — GTD was migrated fully onto it so the surface
is proven.

## Where things live

| | Path |
|---|---|
| Backend plugin code | `backend/src/plugins/<name>/` |
| Backend capability surface (the ONLY core import a plugin may use) | `backend/src/plugins/api.js` |
| Import-boundary lint rule | `backend/eslint.plugins-boundary.js` (`npm run lint:plugins`) |
| Frontend plugin code | `frontend/src/plugins/<name>/` |
| Frontend slot registry | `frontend/src/plugins/registry.js`, `PluginSlot.jsx`, `events.js` |

## Backend

### The rule

A file under `src/plugins/<name>/` may import **only**:
- `../api.js` (the capability surface), and
- its own siblings inside `src/plugins/<name>/`.

It may **not** import `../../services`, `../../utils`, `../../routes`, `../../middleware`,
`../../index`, or platform internals (`../registry.js`, `../storage.js`, …). This is enforced by
`eslint.plugins-boundary.js`. At runtime a plugin's hooks receive a **bounded engine facade**
(`mailEngineFacade.js`), never the raw mail engine.

Run it locally:

```bash
cd backend
npm run lint:plugins   # boundary check — must be 0 violations
npm run lint           # normal lint
npm test               # full suite
```

### Capability surface (`api.js`)

Everything a plugin may do, grouped:

- **Labels (read):** `listThreadHeadsByLabels`, `notifyOnLabelTouch`, `findSurvivingCopy`, `checkMessageCopy` (ask before deleting a label copy that may be the only one)
- **Labels (write):** `applyLabel`, `removeLabel`, `markThreadRead`, `markCopySeen`, `ensureLabelFolders`, `resolveLabelCopyUid` · **Busy answer:** `mailboxBusyBody`
- **Archive:** `archiveInboxCopy`, `moveCopyToInbox`
- **Realtime:** `broadcast` (scoped to one user)
- **Summarize:** `summarizeMessage`, `summarizeAvailable` (fails closed when the AI provider is off)
- **Per-plugin storage:** `storage.*` (the `plugin_data` table — KV + blobs, owner-scoped, cascade-cleaned)
- **Per-account plugin config:** `getAccountConfig`, `setAccountConfig` (the `plugin_account_config` table)
- **Per-message annotations:** `getMessageAnnotations`, `setMessageAnnotation` (namespaced `messages.plugin_annotations`)
- **Panel-wide switch:** `isPluginEnabled`
- **Logging:** `logger` · **Auth middleware:** `requireAuth` · **Folder resolution:** `resolveAllDraftsPaths`, `resolveAllTrashPaths`, `resolveAllSpamPaths`
- **Ownership-scoped mail/account reads:** `loadOwnedMessage`, `getOwnedAccount`, `listUserAccounts`, `getAccountAddresses`, `getMessagesByThreadKeys`, `getMessageCopyFolders`, `getMessageFields`, the thread-key resolvers, …

If you need something not here, **don't reach around the boundary** — ask, and we add a reviewed
capability to `api.js`. That's a small, deliberate core change; the boundary stays intact.

### Manifest + registration

A plugin exports a manifest (see `gtd/index.js`): `{ id, name, version, tier, router?, hooks?, sync? }`.
Core mounts the router and fires the hooks through the registry — core never calls a plugin directly.
`hooks` are the plugin's halves of generic core events (e.g. `inboxIngest`, `afterLabelCopy`,
`onSentMessage`, `validateAccountSettings`, `enrichAccount`, …); `sync` is an optional periodic tick.

### Data

No plugin-specific columns/tables in core. Plugin data lives in generic stores: `plugin_data`
(KV/blobs), `plugin_account_config` (per-account config), `messages.plugin_annotations` (per-message,
namespaced by plugin id). All cascade-clean with their owner.

## Frontend

Core carries no plugin-specific UI code. A plugin registers into a small in-process registry
(imported once at startup via `frontend/src/plugins/index.js`), gated on the panel-wide switch in
`store.enabledPlugins`:

- `registerSlot(name, { pluginId, isActive?, render })` — render UI at a core seam (`right-sidebar`,
  `settings-categories`, `row-hover-action`, …). Rendered with `<PluginSlot>` / `usePluginSlot`.
- `registerCollector(name, { pluginId, build })` — contribute descriptor arrays core renders with its
  own chrome (e.g. context-menu items). Read with `usePluginCollected`.
- `registerRuntime({ pluginId, component })` — a headless component (renders null) that runs
  background effects/subscriptions only while the plugin is activated.
- `registerWsHandler(type, { pluginId, handler })` / `registerReconnectHandler(...)` — handle WS
  message types core doesn't, and resync on reconnect.
- `registerPluginMeta(pluginId, meta)` — static metadata (e.g. where the plugin's settings live).

**Caveat — the one place core still knows about GTD:** the inbox pill-tab strip (Inbox/Todo/Waiting/…)
in `MessageList.jsx` is interleaved with the core *category* tabs (shared tab strip + active-tab
state + list-body swap), so it isn't behind a slot yet. Changes there still touch core. Everything
else (right sidebar, context menu, row actions, settings, WS, the sections fetch) is fully behind the
registry. There's no import-boundary lint on the frontend — but a frontend plugin's blast radius is
one user's own browser (never the server or other users), so it's reviewed lightly.

## Contributing to a plugin

- Work inside `plugins/<name>/`. Keep `npm run lint:plugins` at 0 violations.
- Need a new capability? Open an issue/PR describing it — core adds it to `api.js`.
- Plugins are switched on or off for the whole panel by an administrator (Settings → Plugins,
  `PATCH /api/plugins/:id`, audited as `plugin.enabled` / `plugin.disabled`); off by default.
  Every user gets an enabled plugin. Personal plugin settings (GTD's pet) stay per user.
